Yet another presentation using impress.js
------------------------------------------
All the work that I have done is used impress.js to create a 
webpage. It is very simple and intuitive.

You may want to see [my website](http://naishe.in) to see it in action.
You can view the source code for this [here](https://github.com/naishe/impress/blob/master/index.html).

I will let @bartaz guide you about impress.js


impress.js
============

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and 
transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.

**WARNING**

impress.js may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)


HOW TO USE IT
---------------

[Use the source](http://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/blob/master/index.html), Luke ;)

If you have no idea what I mean by that, or you just clicked that link above and got 
very confused by all these strange characters that got displayed on your screen,
it's a sign, that impress.js is not for you.

Sorry.

Fortunately there are some guys on GitHub that got quite excited with the idea of building
editing tool for impress.js. Let's hope they will manage to do it.

ABOUT THE NAME
----------------

impress.js name in [courtesy of @skuzniak](http://twitter.com/skuzniak/status/143627215165333504).

It's an (un)fortunate coincidence that a Open/LibreOffice presentation tool is called Impress ;)
